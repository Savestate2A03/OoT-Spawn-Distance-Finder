# OoT-Spawn-Distance-Finder
Useful for Farore's Warp / Void Warp shenangings

There's basic instructions included in the python file, don't think much needs to go here.

## Example Output
From lines 43-47 where you edit the point that you want to check other spawn distances from:
```py
# EDIT THESE
x = -1209
y = 40
z = 500
# ----------
```
You will get a list of all entrances in the entrance list and their distance (in 3d space)
```
